### React API연동 연습의 최적화 🙌
 
프론트엔드 개발자가 실무에서 가장 많이 쓴다는 API 연동하기.
절대 빠트려서도, 연습을 안해서도 안된다!

### API 연동하여 데이터 사용하기 ✍

**Axios는 많은 개발자가 사용하는 JavaScript 라이브러리로, HTTP 요청을 간편하게 처리할 수 있게 해줍니다. **

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
